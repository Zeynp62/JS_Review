### What is Function?

**Function** is a term that comes out of mathematics. You may remember hearing it in your high school algebra class.

The basic idea of a function is simple — it's a relationship between a set of inputs and a set of outputs.

## Instructions

- Open **`script.js`** — every exercise is written as a question/comment (for example: `// Exercise 1: maxOfTwoNumbers`).

- **Below each question** there is space for you to write your solution.

- Each exercise already includes a `console.log(...)` call with sample arguments.

  - You only need to write the function body.
  - Do not remove or change the existing `console.log(...)` lines.

- Function names are already provided. Please **use the exact names** so that the existing calls will work correctly.

- Each function should **print the result directly using `console.log`**.
  - The existing `console.log(...)` calls will print a label, and your function will print the actual answer below it.
